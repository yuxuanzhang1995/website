Hello! This is Yuxuan Zhang (张宇轩). I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto, with a joint appointment at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Hosted by [Yong-Baek Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ybkimgroup/home) and [Juan Carrasquilla](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MzM2NzEw.TGlzdC81MTUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html), I have broad interests in quantum computing, condensed matter physics and machine learning.

I completed my early education in my hometown, Tangshan, and graduated from Tangshan No. 1 High School in 2013. I then earned my B.S. in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara with Highest Honors in 2016. Following this, I spent a year at the Institute of High Energy Physics, where I had fun with fundamental particles. In 2017, I attended [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~qic/) and developed a new interest in quantum information and quantum matter. There, I was lucky to be mentored by [Andrew C. Potter](https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/andrew-potter/) and [Scott Aaronson](https://scottaaronson.blog/) throughout my Ph.D. studies.

Apart from my enthusiasm for science and nature, I'm a part-time poet, amateur pianist, unprofessional photographer, and semi-competitive RTS gamer.
