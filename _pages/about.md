Hi! I am Yuxuan Zhang (张宇轩). I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control, University of Toronto, with a joint appointment at the Vector Institute. Hosted by [Yong-Baek Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ybkimgroup/home) and [Juan Carrasquilla](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/juan-felipe-carrasquilla-alvarez/), I have broad interests in quantum computing, condensed matter physics and machine learning.

I completed my early education in my hometown, Tangshan, and graduated from Tangshan No. 1 High School in 2013. I then earned my B.S. in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2016. Following this, I spent a year at the Institute of High Energy Physics, where I delved into particle physics research. In 2017, I attended The University of Texas at Austin and developed a new interest in quantum computation and quantum matter. There, I was mentored by Scott Aaronson and Andrew Potter throughout my Ph.D. studies.
